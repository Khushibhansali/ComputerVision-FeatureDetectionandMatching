I wasn't able to successfully compile the code but I was trying to improve the algorithm doing the following. 

1. Utilize the SIFT algorithm to detect keypoints in the image, capturing scale and orientation information.

2. Create an initial descriptor for each keypoint based on its size, capturing local information in a window around the feature.

3. Improve scale invariance by revisiting the descriptor computation. Adjust the transformation matrix to consider both scale and orientation for each keypoint, allowing for better matching across scales.

4. Apply a spatial transformation to map each pixel in a larger window surrounding the feature to the appropriate pixels in the smaller feature descriptor image. This accounts for scale differences.

5. Separate the affine transformation into scale, rotation, and translation components to accurately represent the keypoint's scale and orientation. I ran into errors here with dimensionality of output for normalizing descriptor vector. 

6. Normalize the descriptor vector to have zero mean and unit variance, ensuring robustness against varying lighting conditions and enhancing feature matching.

7. Return the transformed and normalized descriptors for each keypoint, providing an improved representation that is scale-invariant and robust to changes in orientation.
